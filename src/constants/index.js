        question: "Why Programming?",
        answer: "I've always been facinated with designing things, from my obsession with strategic games as a child to my interest in architecture in general. However it wasn't until I discovered software development that I realised I could utilise these strategic planning skills in a real working environment. Software design requires a combination of innovation and pragmatism that fits my personality perfectly."

        question: "Where are you based?",

    {
        id: 3,
        question: "What are your Specialities?",
        answer: "I'm very versatile in my abilities, but I've largely trained in Dynamic UIs with React, Back-End APIs with NodeJS, OOP with Python and Django, SQL and NoSQL database creation and integration."
    },
    {
        id: 4,
        question: "What are your strengths?",
        answer: "My persistence and discipline when it comes to completing a task, in addition to my no-ego approach to developing myself professionally and personally."
    },
    {
        id: 5,
        question: "What do you enjoy most about software development?",
        answer: "The process of creative problem-solving, and the satisfaction you get from solving a difficult bug is second to none. Also the constant learning and pushing your comfort zone allows you to constantly feel challenged / satisfied all at once."
